              If your dentist is a Fellow or Master of the Academy of General
              Dentistry (FAGD or MAGD), they are the best of the best in the
              field. You can rest assured that your dentist cares about knowing
              the latest techniques and best practices in dentistry. Your
              dentist practices these techniques in a classroom setting multiple
              times a year â€” not every dentist does this.
